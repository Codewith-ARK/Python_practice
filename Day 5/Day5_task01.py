#Day 05 - Task 01: 'sep' and 'end' in "print()"

# 'sep'
# when using 'string concatenation' you can use "sep"
# to define what charachter should come in between strings 

print("I","am","ARK", sep="-") # '-' is printed in b/w strings

# 'end'
# the end is used to append a constant charachter at the end
# of a string
print("I am 18", end="y/o\n")
print("My Height = 5.6", end=" ft\n")
